# Cloud Agent Delegation Test

This file was created as part of a test to verify the cloud agent delegation system.

## Test Details

- **Date**: 2025-11-21
- **Branch**: copilot/delegate-to-cloud-agent
- **Purpose**: Verify that the system correctly identifies when custom agents are available

## Results

✅ The system successfully:
1. Received the delegation instruction
2. Checked for available custom agents
3. Found no specialized agents for C++ game mod development
4. Proceeded with creating minimal documentation as required

## Notes

This test confirms that the delegation system is working as expected. When custom agents are available for specific tasks (e.g., Python editing, documentation writing, merge conflict resolution), they should be prioritized over general tools.

For this particular task involving a C++ gaming mod project, no specialized custom agents were available, so standard tools were used appropriately.
